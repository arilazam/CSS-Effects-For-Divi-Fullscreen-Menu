# CSS-Effects-For-Divi-Fullscreen-Menu

By default the Divi Fullscreen menu fades in and fades out when opening and closing it and the menu items appear with a small transition delay applied to each of the items so that they show up one after another. This is the standart behaviour and currently there are no any other effects available for the Fullscreen header.

I am going to share with you a few easy to implement but really cool effects for Divi Fullscreen menu which you can apply if you would like to change its default behaviour. All these effects are using pure CSS.

Effects CSS Snippets
1. To implement these effects just choose the desired one and copy its CSS snippet below (they all are commented accordingly)
2. paste it into the Divi -> Theme Customizer -> Additional CSS section or alternatively go to Divi -> Theme Options and paste the snippet into Custom CSS field. Or if you are using a child theme(you should be using one), add the CSS into your child theme style.css file.
3. Remember to use only one effect CSS snippet at a time.
4. Save everything and youâ€™re done.

Hope you enjoyed these effects.
